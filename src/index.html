  I choose for Koulen for headers, as it looks more like a monospace font. This fits the game nicely.
  Other alternatives I thought were also pretty good (all from Google Fonts):
  * Bebas Neue (just as good a choice, liked it very much)
  * Luckiest Guy (style is nice, but the letters are too large? Didn't fit well on screens)
  * Bangers (very good for the home screen, but not so much for documentation headers and such)
  * Bungee (matches the style very well, but a bit too much spacing around the letters)
  * Tilt Warp (not all-caps by default, but a good fit overall)
